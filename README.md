# Math Symbol Analyzer

This repository contains my Senior Project during my last year at NMU. This project is the result of three months spent learning how Artificial Neural Networks work and how to apply one in a simple application. The program is written in Python.

This repository contains the trained model and user interface. Information regarding model training will be added at a later date. In terms of the functionality of the program, its performance is sub-par. It's fast and lightweight, but the ANN is innacurate. This project was my first attempt at building an AI application, and was successful at earning me a passing grade.
